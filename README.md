# Minecraft Exchange 
The Minecraft Exchange is a program designed to connect Minecraft servers together, in that they <b>exchange</b> information. This is a server that will only
connect multiple Minecraft servers together, and not offer anything else. It will act as a basis for any other programs to hook into, allowing a multitude of
different systems and networks to be implemented, ranging from economy and stocks to private messages and friends. To make it clear, this is NOT a separate or
new Minecraft server, but instead a general server that any Minecraft server can connect to to get access to the network.

## This is the Minecraft Exchange API.
